## FIAMMA

## Overview

FIAMMA is a specialized MATLAB-based computational tool designed to model and analyze the dynamics of diffusion flames to estimate their Flame Transfer Functions (FTFs). I stared developing this project during my PhD at Imperial College London in the Prof. Morgans Lab. Since the start of the project multiple codes have been developed to address different scenarios. The structure of the project will reflect the different branches of the code.

## Objective

The primary objective of FIAMMA is to create a modular matlab project to study different variants of diffusion flames.

## Key Features

Customizable Domain Parameters: FIAMMA v1.0 allows users to define the physical dimensions of the combustion domain, including the fuel inlet radius, oxidizer outer radius, and the length of the domain. This flexibility enables the simulation of various flame geometries and sizes.

Boundary Condition Specification: Users can set specific mixture-fraction boundary conditions for both the fuel and oxidizer sides, providing control over the composition of the reactants entering the combustion domain.

Velocity Boundary Conditions: The tool allows the specification of inlet velocities for both fuel and oxidizer streams, enabling the study of flame behavior under different flow conditions.

Forcing Inputs: FIAMMA v1.0 includes the functionality to apply perturbations at specified frequencies and amplitudes, facilitating the analysis of flame response to external disturbances.

## Modeling Approach

FIAMMA v1.0 employs a detailed and comprehensive approach to model jet diffusion flames. It begins by setting up the physical parameters of the combustion domain, followed by the specification of mixture-fraction and velocity boundary conditions. The tool then applies forcing inputs, simulating perturbations at user-defined frequencies and amplitudes. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of flame dynamics, particularly the impact of external disturbances on flame stability.

## User Interface and Experience

Designed with user-friendliness in mind, FIAMMA v1.0 features a clear and intuitive interface. Users can easily input parameters, execute simulations, and visualize results. The tool's modular structure enables users to modify or extend its capabilities, allowing for customization to meet specific research needs.

## Application and Relevance

The ability to accurately model and predict the behavior of jet diffusion flames is of paramount importance in numerous industrial applications, including power generation, aerospace, and manufacturing. FIAMMA v1.0's advanced modeling capabilities make it an invaluable tool for researchers and engineers working in these areas. By providing insights into flame stability and dynamics, it aids in the development of more efficient and safer combustion systems.

## Technical Specifications

FIAMMA v1.0 is written in MATLAB, a high-level programming language known for its powerful computational and visualization capabilities. The tool leverages MATLAB's robust numerical methods to solve complex equations governing flame dynamics. It is compatible with various versions of MATLAB, ensuring accessibility to a wide range of users.

## Getting Started

To begin using FIAMMA v1.0, users need a working installation of MATLAB. After loading the tool, users can input their specific parameters for the combustion domain, boundary conditions, and forcing inputs. The tool then runs the simulation, with the output being the Flame Transfer Function, which characterizes the flame's response to the applied perturbations.

## Conclusion

FIAMMA v1.0 stands as a significant contribution to the field of combustion dynamics. Its ability to model and analyze the complex behavior of jet diffusion flames under varying conditions is not just a testament to its computational prowess but also to its potential as a tool for advancing research and development in combustion technology. With FIAMMA v1.0, researchers and engineers have a powerful ally in their quest to design more efficient and safer combustion systems.
